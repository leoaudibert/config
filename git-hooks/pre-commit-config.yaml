# Before being able to use this hook, you will need to install `pre-commit` in your venv:
#   $ pip install pre-commit
#   OR
#   $ brew install pre-commit
#
# Some useful commands:
#   pre-commit clean
#   pre-commit autoupdate
#
# Place this file anywhere you want, I have it in my version controlled config, 
#   then cd into your python repo and run: 
#   $ ln -s ~/.config/myconfig/git-hooks/pre-commit-config.yaml $(pwd)/.pre-commit-config.yaml
# Once you have the config file in the root of your repo, install the hook:
#   $ pre-commit install
#
# Make sure to ignore this file in git, I add it to `.git/info/exclude` to not edit `.gitignore`.
